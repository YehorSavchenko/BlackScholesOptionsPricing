    "# The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "The Black-Scholes option pricing model is a foundational tool in financial markets, used for estimating the prices of call and put options. The model is essential for understanding options pricing and is widely used by traders and financial professionals. This documentation introduces the Black-Scholes model, its key concepts, assumptions, limitations, and how the formula is applied in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction and Historical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Black-Scholes-Merton model**, often referred to simply as the Black-Scholes model, is a mathematical model that estimates the price of European call and put options. Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973, the model revolutionized options trading by providing a standardized formula for valuing options, which led to a significant increase in options trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes model was the first widely accepted formula for options pricing, and it continues to have a significant influence on modern financial markets. Prior to this model, options traders used inconsistent methods for valuing options, but the Black-Scholes model provided a reliable mathematical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Option Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In finance, an **option** is a contract that gives its holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified **strike price** before or on a specified date. There are two main types of options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call Option**: Gives the holder the right to **buy** an asset at the strike price within a specified time frame.\n",
    "- **Put Option**: Gives the holder the right to **sell** an asset at the strike price within a specified time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options provide several advantages, including:\n",
    "- **Income generation**\n",
    "- **Portfolio protection (hedging)**\n",
    "- **Leverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Options\n",
    "\n",
    "- **European Options**: Can only be exercised on the expiration date.\n",
    "- **American Options**: Can be exercised at any time before the expiration date.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Option Moneyness\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of **moneyness** refers to the relationship between the current price of the underlying asset and the strike price of the option. It helps traders determine whether an option is \"in the money,\" \"at the money,\" or \"out of the money.\" The moneyness of an option is crucial for understanding its intrinsic value and likelihood of being exercised.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. In-The-Money (ITM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call Option**: A call option is **in-the-money (ITM)** when the current price of the underlying asset is **higher** than the strike price. This means that the option has intrinsic value because the holder could buy the asset at a lower price than its current market value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    \\text{ITM Call Option} \\Rightarrow \\text{Asset Price} > \\text{Strike Price}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Put Option**: A put option is **in-the-money (ITM)** when the current price of the underlying asset is **lower** than the strike price. This means that the option has intrinsic value because the holder could sell the asset at a higher price than its current market value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    \\text{ITM Put Option} \\Rightarrow \\text{Asset Price} < \\text{Strike Price}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. At-The-Money (ATM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both **call** and **put options** are **at-the-money (ATM)** when the current price of the underlying asset is **equal** to the strike price. At this point, the option has no intrinsic value, but it may still have time value depending on the time remaining until expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    \\text{ATM Option} \\Rightarrow \\text{Asset Price} = \\text{Strike Price}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Out-Of-The-Money (OTM)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Call Option**: A call option is **out-of-the-money (OTM)** when the current price of the underlying asset is **lower** than the strike price. This means the option has no intrinsic value because buying the asset at the strike price would be more expensive than buying it at the current market price.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    \\text{OTM Call Option} \\Rightarrow \\text{Asset Price} < \\text{Strike Price}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Put Option**: A put option is **out-of-the-money (OTM)** when the current price of the underlying asset is **higher** than the strike price. This means the option has no intrinsic value because selling the asset at the strike price would be less profitable than selling it at the current market price.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    \\text{OTM Put Option} \\Rightarrow \\text{Asset Price} > \\text{Strike Price}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Intrinsic Value and Time Value\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing an option's price, it is important to break it down into two components: **intrinsic value** and **time value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intrinsic Value**: This is the real, tangible value of an option if it were exercised immediately. An option has intrinsic value if it is in-the-money (ITM). The intrinsic value for a call option is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    \\text{Intrinsic Value (Call)} = \\max(0, \\text{Asset Price} - \\text{Strike Price})\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "    For a put option, the intrinsic value is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    \\text{Intrinsic Value (Put)} = \\max(0, \\text{Strike Price} - \\text{Asset Price})\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Value**: This represents the potential additional value of the option before it expires. Time value is higher when there is more time remaining until the option expires and is also affected by the volatility of the underlying asset. Time value diminishes as the expiration date approaches, a concept known as **time decay**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    \\text{Time Value} = \\text{Option Premium} - \\text{Intrinsic Value}\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "    The total price of an option (also called the **premium**) is the sum of its intrinsic value and time value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Option Premium\n",
    "\n",
    "The **option premium** is the price a buyer pays to the seller for the option contract. It is composed of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intrinsic Value**: The difference between the current market price and the strike price, if the option is ITM.\n",
    "2. **Time Value**: The value of the potential for the option to gain intrinsic value before expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a call option with a strike price of $50 is purchased for $5 and the current stock price is $55, the intrinsic value is $5 (since $55 - $50 = $5), and if the option has additional time value due to market volatility or time to expiration, the option premium will reflect that as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Types of Option Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various strategies involving options, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Covered Call**: A strategy where the investor holds a long position in a stock and sells a call option on the same stock to generate income.\n",
    "- **Protective Put**: A strategy used to hedge against potential losses in a stock's price by buying a put option to limit downside risk.\n",
    "- **Straddle**: A strategy where the investor buys both a call and a put option with the same strike price and expiration date, expecting large volatility but uncertain of the direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Summary of Moneyness and Option Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In-The-Money (ITM)**: The option has intrinsic value.\n",
    "- **At-The-Money (ATM)**: The strike price equals the current price of the asset.\n",
    "- **Out-Of-The-Money (OTM)**: The option has no intrinsic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Put-Call Parity for European Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes model primarily calculates the price of European **call options**. To calculate the price of a European **put option**, the model relies on **put-call parity**, which defines the relationship between the prices of European calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Put-Call Parity Formula:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "C + \\frac{K}{(1 + r)^t} = S_t + P\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( C \\) = European call option price\n",
    "- \\( P \\) = European put option price\n",
    "- \\( K \\) = Strike price\n",
    "- \\( S_t \\) = Current stock price\n",
    "- \\( r \\) = Risk-free interest rate\n",
    "- \\( t \\) = Time until expiration\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship allows us to calculate the price of a put option using the call option price and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. The Black-Scholes Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes model uses the following formula to estimate the price of a European **call option**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "C = N(d1)S_t - N(d2)Ke^{-rt}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( C \\) = Call option price\n",
    "- \\( S_t \\) = Current stock price\n",
    "- \\( K \\) = Strike price\n",
    "- \\( t \\) = Time until expiration\n",
    "- \\( r \\) = Risk-free interest rate\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma \\) = Volatility of the stock\n",
    "- \\( N(d1) \\) and \\( N(d2) \\) = Cumulative distribution functions for normally distributed variables \\( d1 \\) and \\( d2 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### \\( d1 \\) and \\( d2 \\) formulas:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "d1 = \\frac{ \\ln{\\frac{S_t}{K}} + \\left( r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2} \\right)t }{ \\sigma \\sqrt{t} }\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "d2 = d1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{t}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Variables:\n",
    "- \\( S_t \\): The current price of the underlying asset.\n",
    "- \\( K \\): The strike price, or the price at which the option can be exercised.\n",
    "- \\( t \\): Time to expiration (in years).\n",
    "- \\( r \\): The risk-free interest rate, typically the return on government bonds.\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma \\): Volatility, or the measure of how much the asset’s price fluctuates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Black-Scholes Formula for a **Put Option**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes model also provides a formula to estimate the price of a European **put option**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "P = N(-d2)Ke^{-rt} - N(-d1)S_t\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( P \\) = Put option price\n",
    "- \\( S_t \\) = Current stock price\n",
    "- \\( K \\) = Strike price\n",
    "- \\( t \\) = Time until expiration\n",
    "- \\( r \\) = Risk-free interest rate\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma \\) = Volatility of the stock\n",
    "- \\( N(-d1) \\) and \\( N(-d2) \\) = Cumulative distribution functions for normally distributed variables \\( -d1 \\) and \\( -d2 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Variables:\n",
    "- \\( N(-d1) \\) and \\( N(-d2) \\) represent the probabilities that the option will expire **out of the money**.\n",
    "- The term \\( Ke^{-rt} \\) represents the present value of the strike price, discounted using the risk-free rate over the time until expiration.\n",
    "- The values of \\( d1 \\) and \\( d2 \\) are calculated in the same way as for the call option.\n",

    "## 5. Underlying Assumptions of the Black-Scholes Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying the Black-Scholes model, it's important to understand its assumptions, as they introduce certain limitations when using the model in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lognormal Distribution of Stock Prices**:  \n",
    "   Stock prices are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution, meaning prices cannot go below zero.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **No Dividends**:  \n",
    "   The model assumes that the underlying asset does not pay dividends during the option's life.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Expiration Date**:  \n",
    "   The Black-Scholes model applies to European options, which can only be exercised on their expiration date.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Random Walk**:  \n",
    "   Stock prices follow a random walk, meaning their future movements cannot be predicted and depend solely on new information entering the market.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Frictionless Market**:  \n",
    "   Trading occurs without transaction costs, commissions, or other frictions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Constant Risk-Free Rate**:  \n",
    "   The risk-free interest rate remains constant throughout the option's life.\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. **Constant Volatility**:  \n",
    "   Volatility of the underlying asset is assumed to be constant over the life of the option.\n",
    "   \n",
    "8. **No Arbitrage Opportunities**:  \n",
    "   There are no arbitrage opportunities in the market, meaning it is impossible to make a risk-free profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Applying the Black-Scholes Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "To illustrate how to use the Black-Scholes formula, consider the following example of a call option on Tesla stock:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stock price** (\\( S_t \\)): \\$117.25\n",
    "- **Strike price** (\\( K \\)): \\$100\n",
    "- **Time to expiration** (\\( t \\)): 92 days (0.252 years)\n",
    "- **Risk-free interest rate** (\\( r \\)): 8.5% (0.085)\n",
    "- **Volatility** (\\( \\sigma \\)): 0.8445\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. Calculate \\( d1 \\):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   d1 = \\frac{\\ln \\frac{117.25}{100} + (0.085 + \\frac{0.8445^2}{2}) \\times 0.2520}{0.8445 \\times \\sqrt{0.2520}} = 0.6369\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "2. Calculate \\( d2 \\):\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   d2 = 0.6369 - 0.8445 \\times \\sqrt{0.2520} = 0.2109\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "3. Use the normal cumulative distribution functions for \\( d1 \\) and \\( d2 \\):\n",
    "   - \\( N(d1) = 0.728 \\)\n",
    "   - \\( N(d2) = 0.584 \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Plug values into the Black-Scholes formula:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   C = 0.728 \\times 117.25 - 0.584 \\times 100 e^{-0.085 \\times 0.2520} = 29.4\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical price of the Tesla call option is approximately **\\$29.4**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical price of the Tesla put option is approximately **\\$9.95**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation of Results:\n",
    "- The price of the **call option** was calculated as **\\$29.4**. This means you would need to pay \\$29.4 to have the right to buy Tesla stock at \\$100 in 92 days.\n",
    "- The price of the **put option** was calculated as **\\$9.95**. This means you would need to pay \\$9.95 to have the right to sell Tesla stock at \\$100 in 92 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both examples illustrate how the Black-Scholes model can be applied to estimate the prices of call and put options based on different market parameters such as volatility, risk-free rate, and time to expiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Limitations of the Black-Scholes Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes model has several limitations due to its assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **European Options Only**:  \n",
    "   The model applies only to European options and does not account for American options, which can be exercised before the expiration date.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constant Risk-Free Rate**:  \n",
    "   The model assumes that the risk-free interest rate is constant, which is rarely true in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constant Volatility**:  \n",
    "   Volatility is assumed to be constant, but market conditions often lead to changes in volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Transaction Costs**:  \n",
    "   The model assumes that trading is frictionless, but real-world trading involves fees, commissions, and slippage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Market Assumptions**:  \n",
    "   The model assumes a perfect, efficient market with no arbitrage opportunities, which is not always realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Dividends**:  \n",
    "   The original model does not account for dividend payments, though extensions of the Black-Scholes model include dividends.\n",
